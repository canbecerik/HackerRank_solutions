# HackerRank_solutions

This repository consists of my implementations of various HackerRank Challenges & Tutorials.

I've been solving them occassionally as morning puzzles, but after COVID-19, I found a lot of time at my hands and decided to solve them as much as possible. They are being updated real-time with my progress.

When I am allowed to choose, I usually solve the challenges in Perl 5, C, C++ or Python, depending on my current mood and in no particular order :) The solutions may not be the shortest or most efficient implementations, I prefer to produce clean, maintainable, readable and reusable code over fancy one-liners and this usually reflects on my implementations.

I include pdf versions of the challenges as well, as I would like to keep copies in case they are updated and/or removed.

All directories & assignments are numbered so that they are in the same order as they are in HackerRank.
